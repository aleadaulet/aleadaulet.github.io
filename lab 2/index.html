        <h3 style="color:#0B3954;font-family:verdana;line-height:0.01;text-indent: 50px;">HISTORY</h3>
        <p style="font-family:verdana;text-indent: 50px;line-height: 1.2;">Shymkent was founded in the twelfth century as a caravanserai to protect a nearby <b>Silk Road</b> trade town, Sayram, 10 km to the east. Shymkent grew as a market center for trade between Turkic nomads and the settled Sogdians. It was destroyed several times: by Genghis Khan, soldiers from the southern Khanates, and by nomad attacks. In the early 19th century, it became part of the khanate of Kokand before it was captured by the Russians in 1864. It was renamed <b>Chernyaev</b> in 1914 and renamed <b>Shymkent</b> in 1924. Following the Russian conquest, Shymkent was a city of trade between nomadic Turks and sedentary Turks, and was famous for its <b>kumis</b>.
            Shymkent was founded as <b>a hub for economic development</b> in South Kazakhstan in the 20th century, and rapid growth was evolving in the second half of the century. To date, there are about 70 factories, plants and other manufacturing companies in the area.</p>
